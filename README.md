# RGB2HDMI Video Adapter (for AtariST)
These zip files contain PCB gerbers suitable for production at JLC.  These boards were built and tested and work fine in both my AtariST and Roland S760 sampler (those files are NOT here)  Cases also made at JLC using "JLC Black Resin" using their 3D printing service.
